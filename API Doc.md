Hello and welcome to this not that bad API.

This is realy bad documentation but its all you have now.

To work whith this API you need the following:

Install all the dependecies whith node,

This is a Rest API and the the methods alowed are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

After starting the server go to http://localhost:6996 (6996 is the defult port but you are free to change it)

The routes available are

http://localhost:6996/ => this route get all the todos available (GET)
http://localhost:6996/add  => to add new todos (POST)
http://localhost:6996/get/:id   => the id will the the index of the array of todos since we are not using database (GET)
http://localhost:6996/update/:id  => you can update a todo , again you must use the index of the todo in todos array as the id (PUT)
http://localhost:6996/delete/:id => to delete a todo from todos array, the id is the index in the todos array (DELETE)


The API will validate the todo that you added. The format must the a JSON format when using the POST/PUT request to the api.
The following is the JSON format to use:

{
  "title" : " exemple of title", (must have at least a lenght of 10, required )
  
  "description" : "description of the todo", (lenght required 20)
